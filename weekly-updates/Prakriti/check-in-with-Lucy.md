**What did you achieve?**
- Setting up aims for archer2
- Running test calculations and benchmarks for grid and convergence settings
- Settled on a phonon spectrum convergence critieria, supercells must incorporate octahedral tilting -- no odd expansions in supercells 
**What did you struggle with?**
- Sent Jimmy a word about being added to VASP group, no response

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Prepare to fill in for Lucy's class next week
- Get aims running on Oswald/Archer2
### Date: 30 November 2021
**What did you achieve?**
- Ran my first VASP calculations, setting up with archer2
- Following the tutorial series for VASP and getting acquainted with VASP

**What did you struggle with?**
- Sent Jimmy a word about being added to VASP group, no response

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Get started with aims and plans for spectroscopy

### Date: 23 November 2021
**What did you achieve?**
- Spoke at the CDT week presentation
- Attended the CDT week presentations with all the other cohorts
- Attended the FHI-aims lecture on ab initio thermodynamics calculations

**What did you struggle with?**
- Sent Jimmy a word about being added to VASP group, no response

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Start on the VASP calulations, this is still not done 
- 
### Date: 16 November 2021
**Who helped you this week?**
- Meeting with Guilia regarding the chalcogenide perovskite project to give a clear experimetal motivation for the project
- Lucy with the monitor, helps me be much more productive in the office


**Who did you help this week?**
- Checked in with Daniel's incoming student and helped her with her application from India


**What did you achieve?**
- Submitted the project descripton to Yongtao for the website
- Drafted the CDT week presentation
- Adding new text to the soft-phonons overleaf
- Collecting new text on IR/Raman spectroscopy 
- Finally have access to Archer2, start running serious DFT soon


**What did you struggle with?**
- Talking to Ben about being added to VASP group


**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Geometry relaxation of the chalcogenide perovskite, lowest energy phase from Materials Project/AFLOW/OQMD/ICSD
- Run my first VASP calculation 
- Verify if there are soft modes in the lowest energy phase, use the mode map code to find lower symmetry phase
- Plan for spectroscoPY version with aims
- Schematic diagrams for the soft-phonon modes

**Where do you need help from Lucy?**
- Job scripts on archer and vasp input files
- With the purchasing department for the computer/conference payment
